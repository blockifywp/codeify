We are a team of developers, designers, and entrepreneurs who are passionate about building the future of code collaboration. We believe that the future of code collaboration will be powered by AI and we are building the platform to make that happen.

## Our Story

Codeify began as an experiment in our small digital agency to find out if it was possible to leverage AI to improve our team collaboration and workflow. We were already using a number of code collaboration, project management and communication tools within our team, but we were still struggling to keep up with the ever increasing demands of our clients.

We knew that we needed to find a way to automate some of the repetitive tasks that we were doing every day so that we could focus on the more important things like building our business and serving our clients. We started by building a simple AI powered chatbot that would help us with some of the repetitive tasks that we were doing every day.

We were amazed at how much time it saved us and decided to share it with the world. We launched the beta version in early 2024 and have been growing rapidly ever since.
